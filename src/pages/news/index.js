But where they very much differ is ‚Äî where ‚Äî in that implementation journey they currently are.  Most enterprises rely on the services of the software provider or an AI development company, but those often have technical, but not industry-specific knowledge. Others try to build the capacity in-house, as they prefer that approach to outsourcing. However, not many actually have the resources necessary to tackle the work internally, due to the low availability and high cost of AI experts.",

Financial industry sits on a large amount of client data, but only about 1% of that data is used, significantly hindering the predictive power of models used. By using our airt AI banking engine, customer profiling and targeting, followed by sales, increases 4-8 times. Thanks to all our friends and colleagues who made this occasion special!
